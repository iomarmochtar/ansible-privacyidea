[user-mapping]
# This setting determines the strategy the LDAP proxy uses to determine the username that is sent to privacyIDEA
# from an incoming bind request's DN. There are currently two strategies:
# (1) "lookup": Processing an incoming user bind request, the LDAP proxy connects to the LDAP backend
# using the service account credentials (see above), looks up the user entry using the given DN and retrieves
# the value of a specific attribute (given in the "attribute" setting), which is subsequently used to authenticate
# the user against privacyIDEA
strategy = lookup
attribute = uid
# (2) "match": Processing an incoming user bind request, the LDAP proxy extracts the username directly from the
# user DN. For that, it expects a setting "pattern", a regular expression pattern containing one group, the username.
#strategy = match

# whether the app cache contains a corresponding app marker (so be sure to enable the bind cache)
# If yes, this app marker is mapped to a privacyIDEA realm according to the mapping defined below.
# If the app cache contains no app marker or the app marker is not mapped to a realm,
# the authentication request fails.
# strategy = app-cache
# [[mappings]]
# This maps the app marker "someApp" to the privacyIDEA realm "somerealm".
# someApp = somerealm

[bind-cache]
# If this setting is enabled, successful user bind requests are added to a so-called "bind cache" in which
# they are kept for a specified time. During that time, incoming bind requests using the same credentials
# are internally replaced with bind requests using the service account credentials.
# The timeout is specified in seconds.
# This feature is EXPERIMENTAL.
enabled = false

[app-cache]
# If this setting is enabled, the LDAP proxy maintains a so-called "app cache".
# On user login, apps typically perform a LDAP search to locate the user. When
# they have resolved the DN, they perform the actual bind.
# We use the LDAP search to identify the app: For that, we add an expression like
# `objectclass=App-someApp` to the LDAP filter (without changing the filter semantics).
# We call `someApp` an "app marker". If the LDAP proxy witnesses a search request
# whose filter contains an app marker and whose result has exactly one entry,
# the DN of the entry (the user) as well as the app marker are stored in the app cache
# for a specific timeframe. This information may be used by the `app-cache` realm mapping
# strategy (see below).

#timeout = 5

# case-insensitive = false
